<!-- Background -->
## Background: Project Impetus and Reason
An increasing number of scientific studies continue to underscore the relationship between human health and <strong> air quality </strong>. Recent estimates by the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) say that air pollution costs the average american $2,500 dollars in healthcare costs each year [source](https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/air-pollution-costs-each-american-2500-year-healthcare-study-2021-05-21/). And alarmingly, recent studies have linked increased air pollution with an increase risk of developing dementia in older adults [source](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253253#sec012). The good news, however, is that improved air quality is also associated with better health outcomes including a reduced risk of dementia and alzheimers [source](https://www.aarp.org/health/dementia/info-2021/pollution-brain-health-connection.html). <br>  Given these facts I wanted to build an application that gives health conscious individuals a way to plan their outdoor activities, maximizing the benefit of being activce outdoors by minimizing exposure to outdoor air pollution.
