## Background & Project Impetus
  An increasing number of scientific studies continue to underscore the relationship between human health and <strong> air quality </strong>. Recent estimates by the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) say that air pollution costs the average american $2,500 dollars in healthcare costs each year [source](https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/air-pollution-costs-each-american-2500-year-healthcare-study-2021-05-21/). And alarmingly, recent studies have linked increased air pollution with an increased risk of developing dementia in older adults [source](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253253#sec012). The good news, however, is that improved air quality is also associated with better health outcomes including a reduced risk of dementia and alzheimers [source](https://www.aarp.org/health/dementia/info-2021/pollution-brain-health-connection.html). <br>   Given these facts I wanted to build an application that gives health conscious individuals a way to plan their outdoor activities, maximizing the benefit of being active outdoors by minimizing exposure to outdoor air pollution.  

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About: Air Quality Dashboard Application
Air Quality Dashboard is simple python application (with an upcoming front-end webpage) that helps users avoid air pollution by:
* gives a 48 hour forecast of air quality and UV-index
* uses the best available data sources (Breezometer and Open Weather APIs) 

The files contain: 
1. newapp.py (the python app written in Jupyter Notebooks)
2. index.html (the dashboard that will eventually be used as a frontend to the web app)
3. static folder (contains the accompanying, JavaScript and CSS files that will be used in the front-end)

### Built With 

* Python
* Plotly
* HTML/CSS

### Technologies Used 

* Google Geocoder API
* Breezometer Air Quality API
* Open Weather API (for UV-index forecasts) 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
The newappy.py file will work for any python 3+ user in Jupyter Notebooks. The only caveat is that API keys are not included and must be requested by the user at each respective API service.
